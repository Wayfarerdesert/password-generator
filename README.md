## Future Improvements

We have several future improvements planned for this project, including:

1. Advanced ASCII Characters: We plan to add support for advanced ASCII characters, such as non-standard symbols and special characters, to provide even more options for generating unique and secure passwords.
2. Pass Phrase Generator: We also plan to add a pass phrase generator feature, which will allow users to generate secure pass phrases based on words or phrases, providing an additional layer of security and convenience.

These improvements will further enhance the functionality and usability of our password generator application, providing users with even more tools to manage their online security effectively.
